# Flatpak for Godot Engine

## Installation

This Flatpak is available on
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.godotengine.Godot).
After following the [Flatpak setup guide](https://flatpak.org/setup/),
you can install it by entering the following command in a terminal:

```bash
flatpak install --user flathub org.godotengine.Godot -y
```

Once the Flatpak is installed, you can run Godot using your desktop environment's
application launcher.

## Updating

This Flatpak follows the latest stable Godot version.
To update it, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
flatpak update
```

## Using an external script editor

This version of Godot is built with special [permissions](https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot/blob/394f81c3310b82f5069ea917bb21f49888f818c6/org.godotengine.Godot.yaml#L46) to be able to run commands on the host system outside of the sandbox via [flatpak-spawn](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/flatpak-command-reference.html#flatpak-spawn). This is done by prefixing the command with `flatpak-spawn --host`. For example, if you want to run `gnome-terminal` on the host system outside of the sandbox, you can do so by running `flatpak-spawn --host gnome-terminal`.

To spawn an external editor in Godot, all command line arguments must be split from the commands path in the [external editor preferences](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/editor/external_editor.html) and because the command needs to be prefixed with `"flatpak-spawn --host"`, the **Exec Path** is replaced by `flatpak-spawn` and the **Exec Flags** are prefixed by `--host [command path]`.

For example, for Visual Studio Code, where your [external editor preferences](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/getting_started/editor/external_editor.html) would *normally* look like this...

```text
Exec Path:  code
Exec Flags: --reuse-window {project} --goto {file}:{line}:{col}
```

...it should look like this **inside the Flatpak sandbox**:

```text
Exec Path:  flatpak-spawn
Exec Flags: --host code --reuse-window {project} --goto {file}:{line}:{col}
```

## Limitations

- No C#/Mono support
  ([#8](https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot/issues/8)).

## Building from source

Install Git, follow the
[flatpak-builder setup guide](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/first-build.html)
then enter the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot.git
cd org.godotengine.Godot/
flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk//20.08 -y
flatpak-builder --force-clean --install --user -y builddir org.godotengine.Godot.yaml
```

If all goes well, the Flatpak will be installed after building. You can then
run it using your desktop environment's application launcher.

You can speed up incremental builds by installing [ccache](https://ccache.dev/)
and specifying `--ccache` in the flatpak-builder command line (before `builddir`).
