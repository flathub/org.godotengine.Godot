      <li>Visual editor with all the tools you need packed into a beautiful and uncluttered context-sensitive UI.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Limitations of the Flatpak version:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No C#/Mono support. See: https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot/issues/8</li>
      <li>Custom builds for Android don't work. See: https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot/issues/63</li>
      <li>The old-fashioned way of exporting to Android still works: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html</li>
      <li>External script editors are supported, but you need to follow the steps described here: https://github.com/flathub/org.godotengine.Godot#using-an-external-script-editor</li>
